<b><h4>Ada Lovelace</h4></b> 
Ada Lovelace is a British mathematician born on the 10th of December 1815, also known as August Ada Byron or  Lady Byron.
In the mid-1800s, she wrote an algorithm for a computing machine, which earned her recognition as “the first computer programmer”.
She was a gifted mathematician who became the mentee of Charles Babbage at age 17.Lovelace didn’t have a typical upbringing for an upper-class girl.
She was taught mathematics and science which was commonly frowned upon for women during that period in history.
<a href="#(Biography.com Editors website,2021)"><I>(Biography.com Editors website,2021)</I></a>.

<b><h5><u>modern applications</u></h5></b> 
Ada wrote the first algorithm explaining how Charles Babbage’s analytical engine could calculate Bernoulli numbers.
She outlined step-by-step operations that included calculations, storing results and data fetching a process now known as execution trace. 
.She described conditional logic and loops, and she also foresaw the future of using codes to generate music 
and patterns and showing an extraordinary vision for computing<a href="#(Sarah Baldwin,2018)"><I>(Sarah Baldwin,2018)</I></a>.

<b><h5><u>impact</u></h5></b>
Ada wrote codes for machines that were not yet in existence making her the pioneer of computer programmes.
She provided the blueprint for programming which can be attributed to her power of imagination in technology.
This has inspired countless people to pursue careers in science and technology<a href="#(Ashley Cavanagh,2022)"><I>(Ashley Cavanagh,2022)</I></a>.
Ada Lovelace has provided the blueprint for programming inspiring countless people to pursue careers in science and technology. 
She is a symbol of the power of imagination in technology. 

<b><h4>Josephine Cochrane</h4></b> 
Josephine Cochrane was born on 8th March 1841 in the state of Ohio to her civil engineer father John Garis and her great grandfather John Fitch, 
who was the inventor of steamboat innovations.

She was inspired to invent the dishwasher after her servants chipped her fine China repeatedly. 
She took over dishwashing as they were her prized possessions and found it very tedious, so she decided to find a better solution.
As a result, she worked with a local mechanic to design a machine that used water pressure to clean dishes which she patented in 1886.
This came to be known as  Cochrane’s dishwasher<a href="#(Mit. edu,2019)"><I>(Mit. edu,2019)</I></a>.

<b><h5><u>modern applications</u></h5></b>
Josephine Cochrane’s dishwasher has evolved into an appliance that has numerous applications in different places, making chores simpler.
Today, this machine is part of the typical household.

<b><h5><u>impact</u></h5></b>
When dishwashers were initially created their main purpose was to provide a less tedious means of washing dishes.
However, its creation has reaped numerous benefits over the years. Dishwashers are now more environmentally conscious.
They are built to conserve water and energy while ensuring a thorough clean with high-temperature cycles to reduce the spread of germs as such,
making the process more hygienic<a href="#(Universal Appliance and Kitchen Center,2018)"><I>(Universal Appliance and Kitchen Center,2018)</I></a>.

<b><h4>Hedy Lamar</h4></b>
Hedy Lamar was an Austrian-American actor who made advanced contributions to technology
by revolutionising frequency hopping which is now the foundation for GPS, Bluetooth and Wi-Fi.

She was born in 1914 in Vienna, Austria with parents who had notably different interests.
Her father’s interest in the mechanics of how things worked fostered her interest in problem-solving and innovation
while her concert pianist mother cultivated her appreciation for creativity and performance. 
These two contributed to the dual passion for acting and inventing. 
She was later in a controlling marriage to Fritz Mandl, an Austrian arms manufacturer and industrialist who by association introduced her to weaponry and wartime strategies.

Hedy Lamarr and George Antheil, a well-known composer of experimental music were able to devise a system based on ‘frequency hopping’.
This was meant to help torpedoes hit their targets when at the time, they were controlled by radio signals which could be jammed by their enemies.

Frequency hopping involves both the transmitter and receiver rapidly switching between multiple frequencies in a synchronised pattern,
making it nearly impossible for enemies to intercept or disrupt the communication.
Antheil applied his knowledge of synchronisation to make sure he coordinated the complex mechanical and rhythmic patterns
<a href="#(Colleen Cheslak, 2018)"><I>(Colleen Cheslak, 2018)</I></a>.

<b><h5><u>modern applications</u></h5></b>
The use of frequency hopping was originally meant for the military to use as a secure communication system and now it is used in commercial telecommunication
in the following ways:

    <tr>
        <td>Bluetooth </td>
        <td>Allows secure short-range wireless communication between 
devices like headphones, speakers and smartphones</td>
   </tr>
     <tr>
        <td>GPS</td>
        <td>Allows for exact communication between satellites and devices
enhancing navigation</td>
   </tr>
</table>
<b><h5><u>impact</u></h5></b>
Hedy Lamarr’s invention of frequency hopping has impacted how people communicate and interact with their devices.
During COVID-19, it was useful for remote learning and work allowing people to collaborate.
It makes our day-to-day operations more efficient and user-friendly. (Jason Marcel, 2018)

The inventions of Ada Lovelace, Josephine Cochrane and Hedy Lamarr continue to have an immeasurable impact to this day.
They have transformed industries from communication technology to home appliances making our everyday lives integrated, convenient and efficient.

They are examples of how innovation and creativity change the world, inspiring future women to pursue careers in science and technology.
And even though they had no formal education in science or technology they were able to make a difference. 
They show how technology is not just about technicality but also creativity, problem-solving and addressing human needs.
These stories tell us about people who faced challenges and used their imagination to create solutions which have had a lasting impact on future generations.
